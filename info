Fall 2022 
CSCB07 – Software Design 
Lab 1 
 
Objectives 
 Getting familiar with Java 
 Learning how to compile and run a Java program from a command line  
 Getting familiar with Git 
 
Logistics 
 This lab is worth 3% of the course grade and it will be supervised by your TA during the tutorial 
session of Week 3 (Sep 19-23, 2022). If you encounter any problem while doing the steps listed in 
the next section, ask the TA for help. 
 Attendance will be taken during the tutorial. If you are unable to attend, please send your TA an 
email explaining why and make sure to submit the deliverables by the due date. Failing to do so 
might result in a grade of zero on this lab. 
 The lab should be done individually. 
 The due date is Sep 25, 2022. 
 
Instructions 
1. Download and install JDK: 
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html 
 
2. Windows users might have to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable as follows: 
 
Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced system settings -> 
Advanced -> Environment Variables -> System Variables -> New and set JAVA_HOME 
by specifying the path to the JDK directory (the path on your machine might be different 
than the one shown in the example below)

3. If Git is not installed on your machine, download it and then install. 
4. If you don’t already have a Github account, create one here. 
5. Create a personal access token to be used for authentication. More information could be found 
here. 
6. On Github, create a repo named b07lab1 as per these instructions and make sure to make it public. 
7. Navigate to the repo and create a new file: name it “info”, add some information about the lab, 
and click the “Commit new file” button. 
8. On your machine, do the following steps using Command Prompt/Terminal: 
a. Clone the repo using the command git clone RepoURL (RepoURL should be replaced by 
the actual URL of your repo) 
b. cd b07lab1   
c. Windows users: 
notepad Polynomial.java (answer “Yes” when asked if you want to create a new file) 
 
Mac users: 
touch Polynomial.java 
open Polynomial.java 
 
d. Develop class Polynomial as follows: 
i. It has one field representing the coefficients of the polynomial using an array of 
double. A polynomial is assumed to have the form 𝑎0 +𝑎1𝑥1 +⋯+𝑎𝑛−1𝑥𝑛−1. 
For  example,  the  polynomial  6−2𝑥+5𝑥3  would  be  represented  using  the 
array [6, -2, 0, 5]  
ii. It  has  a  no-argument  constructor  that  sets  the  polynomial  to  zero  (i.e.  the 
corresponding array would be [0]) 
iii. It  has  a  constructor  that  takes  an  array  of  double  as  an  argument  and  sets  the 
coefficients accordingly 
iv. It  has  a  method  named  add  that  takes  one  argument  of  type  Polynomial  and 
returns the polynomial resulting from adding the calling object and the argument 
v. It  has  a  method  named  evaluate  that  takes  one  argument  of  type  double 
representing a value of x and evaluates the polynomial accordingly. For example, 
if the polynomial is 6−2𝑥+5𝑥3 and evaluate(-1) is invoked, the result should 
be 3. 
vi. It  has  a  method  named  hasRoot  that  takes  one  argument  of  type  double  and 
determines whether this value is a root of the polynomial or not. Note that a root 
is a value of x for which the polynomial evaluates to zero.    
e. Save the file 
f. Windows users: 
notepad Driver.java (answer “Yes” when asked if you want to create a new file)  
 
Mac users: 
touch Driver.java 
open Driver.java 
 
g. Add the following code, then save and close the file 
 
 
 
  Fall 2022 
public class Driver { 
 public static void main(String [] args) { 
  Polynomial p = new Polynomial(); 
  System.out.println(p.evaluate(3)); 
  double [] c1 = {6,0,0,5}; 
  Polynomial p1 = new Polynomial(c1); 
  double [] c2 = {0,-2,0,0,-9}; 
  Polynomial p2 = new Polynomial(c2); 
  Polynomial s = p1.add(p2); 
  System.out.println("s(0.1) = " + s.evaluate(0.1)); 
  if(s.hasRoot(1)) 
   System.out.println("1 is a root of s"); 
  else 
   System.out.println("1 is not a root of s"); 
 } 
} 
 
h. javac Driver.java 
 
i. java Driver 
 
j. Verify that the output you obtain is as follows: 
0.0 
s(0.1) = 5.8041 
1 is a root of s 
 
k. git add *.java 
l. git commit -m “added Polynomial.java and Driver.java” 
m.  git push 
 
9. Submit the URL of your repo to “Lab 1” on Quercus.
